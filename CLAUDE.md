## Project Overview

**devzone** is a testbed repo for prototyping software projects. It is a Node.js package (v0.1.0) licensed under CC0-1.0. The entry point is `index.js` (not yet created).

## Current State

This is a freshly initialized project with no source code, dependencies, build system, test framework, or linting configured. The `npm test` script is currently a recursive no-op and needs a real test runner before use.
